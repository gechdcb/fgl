This is a small fast fixed point graphics library with an interface similar to OpenGL. It is cross-platform and performs translation and rendering into an RGB565 buffer.

This project is dependent on [libfixmath](http://code.google.com/p/libfixmath), and is utilized by the [Dingoo SDK](http://code.google.com/p/dingoo-sdk).

Currently the only samples on how to use this are included as part of the [Dingoo SDK](http://code.google.com/p/dingoo-sdk) but hopefully this will change as the project branches, the library itself only just renders to a rectangular RGB565 buffer and so is completely platform independent.

For clarification and since googlecode doesn't allow me to modify the license section beyond picking from 10 licenses. This code is distributed under the LGPL with the Linking Exception.
